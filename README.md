## Course Description

Design and development of assemblers, linkers, loaders, and
compilers. Study memory hierarchy, program performance, and system
level I/O.

## Learning Outcomes

This course is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of real
and virtual machines as language processor and the implementation of
compilers. We will study the processor as an instruction
interpreter. Compilers, assemblers, linkers and loaders, and virtual
machines will be presented as systems software for program
development. An introduction to Operating system will be given.

## Grading

- 20% Midterm Exam: closed book, closed notes exam given in class
- 30% Final Exam: closed book, closed notes comprehensive exam given during final exam week. _You must score at least 60% on this exam to pass the course_
- 50% Programming project
  - 10% Assignment 1 VM/0
  - 5% Assignment 2 Lexer
  - 5% Assignment 3 Parser/Code Gen
  - 20% Assignment 4 Compiler
- _Extra_ 7%: Participation, recitation attendance, quizzes.
  Completion of these tasks can add extra percentage points, e.g., if
  you receive an 86% average on the exams and project and 6% on the
  recitations and quizzes, your final score will be a 92%.

__No late submissions for the programming project will be accepted__
except in accordance with University policy.  However, the programming
project is cumulative: assignments 2-4 each depend on the previous
assignment and assignment 4 depends on all previous assignments.  The
assignment weights reflect this dependence.

### Grade Calculation

The score is a weight average of the exams and programming project
plus the extra points, i.e.,

    (midterm * 20% + final * 30% + project * 50%) + extra
    
### Letter grades

A >= 90%, B+ >= 87%, B >= 80%, C+ >= 77%, C >= 70%, D >= 60%, F < 60%.

### Programming Project

The programming project consists in implementing a compiler for a tiny
programming language. The compiler must generate code for a virtual
machine that will run. The project will be divided in four modules:

1. Virtual Machine implementation (VM/0)
2. Lexer
3. Parser/Code Generation
4. Compiler

Details will be given out well before the due dates for each part of
the project.

This project must be written in C (not C++) on a UNIX system. The
standard for this class will be the Linux system in the main computer
lab called Eustis. You are welcome to write and test code on some
other system, if you wish, but it will be graded on Eustis and if it
does not work there, it does not work. You will be given a Eustis
account at the beginning of the semester, and instructions on how to
access your account can be found on the Assignments section at the
course's webpage.
