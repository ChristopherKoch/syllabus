## Class
  most machines are built on the von-neumann architecture
  the advantage is in the memory, where the data lives in the memory
  and the program lives in the memory as well
  thus, the code/program is also data
  Example: A calculator that automates the task of entering operations and performing said operations
  
  **Parts of VN Architecture**
  * PC - Program Counter, keeps track of where you are in your code
  * MAR - Address register, tells the memory where to get the data from or read data to
  * MEM - Memory
  * IR - Instruction Register
    * OP - Operation, stores the opcode numerical values
    * Address, address
  * A - Accumulator, stores the data being used as inputs, its like a constantly working memory
  * Decoder, gets the actual instruction from the opcode
  * MDR - Memory Data register, an intermediate between sending/receiving instructions/data from MEM
  * ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit, performs math
  
  **Instruction Cycle** 
  
  They run only two cycles, fetch (loads from memory) and execution (performs an operation). Refer to slides on fetch and different executions 
  
  **Instruction Set Architecture**
  
  Instructions the machine follows to perform a cycle. 
  The format (made of 16 bits) consist of an opcode (4 bits) and an address (12 bits). 
  The instructions we are working with are:
  
  1. LOAD <X>
  2. ADD <X> ,loading and addition are performed at the same time and results stored in A
  3. STORE <X>
  4. SUB <X> loading and subtraction are performed at the same time and results stored in A
  5. IN <Device #> reads from device to A
  6. OUT <Device #> dumps memory to device
  7. HALT
  8. JMP <X> ,like a goto
  9. SKIPZ, skips next instruction like an if statement, uses the Z flag
  
  * Two more flags can be incorporated, G (greater than) and L (less than)
  * labels (eg; C, X or Y) are assigned to temporary memory locations (eg: 001, 002..)
  
  **Assembler Directives**
  
  Pseudo-ops used to perform special actions
  * .begins, where program starts
  * .data, where data is being stored
  * .where program ends
  * HALT separates .begins and .data
  * The specific amount of memory needs to be preset before the program starts
